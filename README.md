## Overview

Lets be honest. There is no better project than a simple todo app to get comfortable with whatever it is that you're using. In my case I learnt how to make an API in Go and how to use TypeScript in React.

## Built With

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
