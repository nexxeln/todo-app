## Overview

Lets be honest. There is not a better project that a simple todo app to get comfortable with whatever it is that you're using. In my case I learn how to make an API in Go and how to use TypeScript in React.

## Built With

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
